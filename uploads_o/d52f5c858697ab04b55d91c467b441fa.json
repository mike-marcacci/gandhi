					"info": "<h1>Vision Grants</h1>\n\n<p>Vision Funds are designed to encourage faculty to explore new uncertain directions for their research rather than support the existing research agendas. Vision grants should be used to systematically test the theoretic assumptions underlying a research project and its potential to grow into a large research initiative. In addition, they serve to support preliminary work for a large research proposal to support a substantial research agenda with external funding. Vision projects can originate either as Seed projects or outside of the Big Questions Incubator. Vision grants are peer-reviewed and are focused on supporting data-generating activities, such as</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Conducting experiments</li>\n\t<li>Sharing a post-doctoral fellow between departments</li>\n\t<li>Developing new techniques, or</li>\n\t<li>Other relevant activities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Vision awards will range from $50,000 - $100,000 for a maximum of 12 months of research work. The proposals should present a plan on how the grant will be crucial in allowing the research team to secure substantial external funding at later stages. These projects may receive customized support from the BQI <a href=\"http://bigquestions.uchicago.edu/about/team\">team</a> and <a href=\"http://arete.uchicago.edu/\">Arete</a>, a strategic research development unit at the Vice President for Research office. Support may involve developing a long-term operational plan and assistance in seeking additional external support in subsequent stages of the project.</p>\n",
